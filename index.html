          >Volleyball</a
        > is a team sport played on a rectangular court, divided by a net, with<br>
          six players on each side. The objective is to score points by sending<br>
          the ball over the net and into the opponent's court, with each team<br>
          allowed up to three touches to return the ball. The game begins with<br>
          a serve and continues as teams rally the ball back and forth, aiming<br>
          to prevent the ball from hitting the ground on their side. Players<br>
          specialize in different positions, such as setter, outside hitter,<br>
          opposite hitter, middle blocker and libero, each playing a critical<br>
          role in offense and defense. Volleyball is played both indoors and<br>
          outside(beach volleyball), and is known for its strategic play,<br>
          athleticism, and teamwork.

      <p style="text-align: center;">
        Volleyball is played in sets, and teams compete to win the best of<br>
        three or five sets. To win a set, a team must score 25 points<br>
        (or 15 in the 5th set) with at least a two-point advantage over the<br>
        opponent. Points are earned when a team successfully hits the ball<br>
        onto the ground of the oponent's court or if the other team hits it<br>
        out of bounds or makes a mistake (touching the net). Each team<br>
        rotates players clockwise after winning the serve (scoring a point<br>
        after not serving), ensuring that all players take turns in each<br> 
        position on the court. The game requires a combination of skills,<br>
        including serving, setting, spiking, blocking, and digging, making<br>
        it a dynamic sport that challenges both offensive and defensive<br>
        strategies. Understanding these basic rules is essential for<br>
        appreciating volleyball and how teamwork creates success on the court.

      <p style="text-align: center;">
        To win in volleyball, players must develop a range of skills that<br>
        combine athleticism and precision. Serving is the first key skill,<br>
        where players aim and add power to deliver the ball strategically<br>
        over the net to mess up the opponent and possibly score. Setting<br>
        requires accuracy, as the setter’s job is to place the ball in<br>
        the ideal position for the hitter to spike it. Spiking is a<br>
        powerful offensive move that involves hitting the ball forcefully<br>
        over the net to score points. Blocking, a defensive skill, involves<br>
        jumping near the net to prevent the ball from coming over, while<br>
        digging requires quick reflexes to prevent the ball from hitting<br>
        the ground after an opponent’s attack. Mastering these techniques,<br>
        along with communication and teamwork, is crucial for success in volleyball.
