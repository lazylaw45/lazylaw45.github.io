          >Volleyball</a
        > is a team sport played on a rectangular court, divided by a net, with
          six players on each side. The objective is to score points by sending the ball 
          over the net and into the opponent's court, with each team allowed up to three 
          touches to return the ball. The game begins with a serve and continues as teams 
          rally the ball back and forth, aiming to prevent the ball from hitting the ground 
          on their side. Players specialize in different positions, such as setter, outside
          hitter, opposite hitter, middle blocker and libero, each playing a critical role 
          in offense and defense. Volleyball is played both indoors and outside 
          (beach volleyball), and is known for its strategic play, athleticism, and teamwork.

      <h2>Getting to Know the Rules</h2>

        Volleyball is played in sets, and teams compete to win the best of three or five sets.
        To win a set, a team must score 25 points (or 15 in the 5th set) with at least a 
        two-point advantage over the opponent. Points are earned when a team successfully hits the 
        ball onto the ground of the oponent's court or if the other team hits it out of bounds or 
        makes a mistake (touching the net). Each team rotates players clockwise after winning the 
        serve (scoring a point after not serving), ensuring that all players take turns in each 
        position on the court. The game requires a combination of skills, including serving, 
        setting, spiking, blocking, and digging, making it a dynamic sport that challenges both 
        offensive and defensive strategies. Understanding these basic rules is essential for 
        appreciating volleyball and how teamwork creates success on the court.

        To win in volleyball, players must develop a range of skills that combine 
        athleticism and precision. Serving is the first key skill, where players aim and add power to deliver 
        the ball strategically over the net to mess up the opponent and possibly score. Setting requires 
        accuracy, as the setter’s job is to place the ball in the ideal position for the hitter 
        to spike it. Spiking is a powerful offensive move that involves hitting the ball forcefully
        over the net to score points. Blocking, a defensive skill, involves jumping near the net to 
        prevent the ball from coming over, while digging requires quick reflexes to prevent the ball 
        from hitting the ground after an opponent’s attack. Mastering these techniques, along with 
        communication and teamwork, is crucial for success in volleyball.
